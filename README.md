# studbud

During the process of creating my StudBud web app prototype, I decided to interate on my original design. These decisions were made both with consideration to the usability of the site and my own coding ability.

The main change that was made was to combine all functionality (kanban board, stopwatch, reading and task lists) onto a single page. This was to make it easier for users to access all of the functional parts of the web app, and would (theoretically) make it easier for me to code, as I had concerns about my coding ability in producing my original plan. 

With this change came experimentation with the positioning of elements within the page, as the removal of nav elements and extra elements on the homepage meant that reshuffling was required. Eventually I settled on a sidebar and content layout, with the kanban/reading/tasklist elements inside.

This also meant changing the layout and CSS Grid structure for my responsive CSS for mobile to better reflect this new approach. 

I have had many issues and stuggles with implementing parts of my code, in particular the Javascript parts for the reading/task lists and implementing local storage, as I'm sure is obvious.  While in my head I am able to see how local storage works, when I put it into practice I am struggling with it and cannot seem to find where I am going wrong. Aside from struggles with local storage, elements such as buttons and their associated functionalities were painful.

Code has been used from the DECO2017 Slack, in relation to the appending of divs/elements for the Kanban Board and local storage for the lists, primarily the code and video tutorial posted by Drew on May 24th in the general channel. 

Apologies for the poor Javascript, however I hope that my CSS and HTML code is just a tiny bit more palatable!.
